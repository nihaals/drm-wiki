Researching DRM like Widevine, FairPlay and PlayReady is difficult. There are plenty of multi-DRM platforms that offer support for these 3 technologies, but if you want to learn how it works, write your own server or even just get a rough idea of what it exactly *is*, there isn't much material that is publicly available.

This wiki aims to explain roughly how each of these work, how you can write your own server, how to watch DRM protected content and some related concepts.

If you want to provide DRM protected content, you usually need to support all 3 of these technologies. Each one supports a subset of popular platforms. You can learn about where each one is used on their respective about pages.
